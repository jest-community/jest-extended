Additional Jest matchers

## Problem

Jest is an amazing test runner and has some awesome assertion APIs built in by default. However, there are times when having more specific matchers (assertions) would be far more convenient.

## Solution

jest-extended aims to add additional matchers to Jest's default ones making it easy to test everything 🙌
