## Making changes

 - All changes should have unit tests
 - Any relevant documentation should be updated
 - No linting warnings/errors should be introduced

### New Matchers

 - Each matcher should be placed in it's own directory inside of the `matchers` directory.
 - A matcher directory should contain the following:
   * index.js - An export of the matcher in the format expected by Jest. See the docs for an [example](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/expect.html#expectextendmatchers). Note: the test outcome messages must be a function that returns a string (this caught me out ðŸ˜‰).
   * index.test.js - Test suite that uses the new matcher and make sure it passes.
   * predicate.js - The function that tests the actual value meets the expected value / behavior.
   * predicate.test.js - Tests for the predicate both true/false cases must be covered.
 - [`jest-matchers-utils`](https://github.com/facebook/jest/tree/master/packages/jest-matcher-utils) is being used for syntax highlighting of error messages.
   * See the Jest docs for an [example usage](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/expect.html#thisutils)
 - Jest's [`expect`](https://github.com/facebook/jest/tree/master/packages/expect) package is being used to access their deep `equals` function.
   * `import { equals } from 'expect/build/jasmine_utils';`
 - Once a matcher has been created it needs to be added to the `src/matchers/index.js` re-export.
 - Docs for the new matcher should be updated in the API section of the README.md to no longer say `Unimplemented`.

## Committing and Pushing changes

Once you are ready to commit the changes, please use the below commands

1. `git add <files to be comitted>`
2. `git commit -m 'A meaningful message`

*Note: please use present tense in commit messages i.e. `Add feature X` and not ~`Added feature X`~*

## Add yourself as a contributor

This project follows the [all contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors)
specification. To add yourself to the table of contributors on the README.md, please use
the automated script as part of your PR:

```console
yarn contributor <YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>
```

Follow the prompt. If you've already added yourself to the list and are making a
new type of contribution, you can run it again and select the added contribution
type. If you need to edit the `.all-contributorsrc` file by hand that's fine
too, just run `yarn contributor:gen` to regenerate the table
